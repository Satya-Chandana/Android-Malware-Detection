## Proposed Methodology

### Models Implemented and Its Analysis

#### XGBoost:

XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency in processing and analyzing large datasets. It sequentially builds decision trees, emphasizing the importance of correcting mistakes. Regularization terms control model complexity to prevent overfitting.

#### Random Forest:

Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness. It excels in handling high-dimensional feature spaces, making it ideal for complex datasets like CICMaldroid.

#### LightGBM:

LightGBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework designed for efficiency and scalability. Its histogram-based learning approach optimizes the binning process for faster computation, making it suitable for feature-rich datasets.

#### BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory):

BiLSTM is a deep learning architecture effective in capturing sequential information. It dynamically learns temporal dependencies within the dataset, making it suitable for malware detection tasks.

#### LSTM-CNN (Long Short-Term Memory - Convolutional Neural Network):

LSTM-CNN combines LSTM and CNN architectures to capture both sequential and spatial features from the input data, making it effective for malware detection and classification.

#### Bi-LSTM-CNN (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory - Convolutional Neural Network):

Bi-LSTM-CNN integrates bidirectional LSTM layers with CNN layers, capturing both temporal and spatial patterns present in the data.

### Explainable AI:

Explainable AI techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), are integrated to provide clear insights into individual predictions, enhancing model interpretability and trustworthiness.

## Data Science Interpretation for Malware Detection

Random Forest Classification is employed to investigate how specific variables influence the model's classification of different app categories. Feature importance scores and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are analyzed to understand the impact of individual features on classification outcomes.

## Results and Discussion

Various machine learning and deep learning models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. LSTM-CNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, and AUC, highlighting its effectiveness in malware detection.
